# package::forecastML <img src="./man/figures/forecastML_logo.png" alt="forecastML logo" align="right" height="138.5" style="display: inline-block;">

The purpose of `forecastML` is to provide a series of functions and visualizations that simplify the process of 
**multi-step-ahead direct forecasting with standard machine learning algorithms**. It's a wrapper package aimed at providing maximum flexibility in model-building--**choose any machine learning algorithm from any `R` package**--while helping the user quickly assess the (a) accuracy, (b) stability, and (c) generalizability of grouped (i.e., 
multiple related time series) and ungrouped single-outcome forecasts produced from potentially high-dimensional modeling datasets.

This package is inspired by Bergmeir, Hyndman, and Koo's 2018 paper 
[A note on the validity of cross-validation for evaluating autoregressive time series prediction](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2017.11.003). 
In particular, `forecastML` makes use of 

* **lagged, grouped, dynamic, and static features**,
* **simple wrapper functions that support models from any `R` package**,
* **nested cross-validation** with (a) user-specified standard cross-validation in the inner loop and (b) block-contiguous validation 
datasets in the outer loop, and
* **parallel processing** with the `future` package 

to build and evaluate high-dimensional forecast models **without having to use methods that are time series specific**. 

The following quote from Bergmeir et al.'s article nicely sums up the aim of this package:

> "When purely (non-linear, nonparametric) autoregressive methods are applied to forecasting problems, as is often the case
> (e.g., when using Machine Learning methods), the aforementioned problems of CV are largely
> irrelevant, and CV can and should be used without modification, as in the independent case."

## Cheat Sheet

![](./tools/forecastML_cheat_sheet.png)

## Key functions

1. **`fill_gaps`:** Optional if no temporal gaps/missing rows in data collection. Fill gaps in data collection and 
prepare a dataset of evenly-spaced time series for modeling with lagged features. Returns a 'data.frame' with 
missing rows added in so that you can either (a) impute, remove, or ignore `NA`s prior to the `forecastML` pipeline 
or (b) impute, remove, or ignore them in the user-defined modeling function--depending on the `NA` handling 
capabilities of the user-specified model.

2. **`create_lagged_df`:** Create model training and forecasting datasets with lagged, grouped, and static features.

3. **`create_windows`:** Create time-contiguous validation datasets for model evaluation.

4. **`train_model`:** Train the user-defined model across forecast horizons and validation datasets.

5. **`return_error`:** Compute forecast error across forecast horizons and validation datasets.

6. **`return_hyper`:** Return user-defined model hyperparameters across validation datasets.

## FAQ

* **Q:** Where does `forecastML` fit in with respect to popular `R` machine learning packages like [mlr3](https://mlr3.mlr-org.com/) and [caret](https://github.com/topepo/caret)?
* **A:** The idea is that `forecastML` takes care of the tedious parts of forecasting with ML methods: creating training and forecasting datasets with different 
types of features--grouped, static, and dynamic--as well as simplifying validation dataset creation to assess model performance at specific points in time. 
That said, the workflow for packages like `mlr3` and `caret` would mostly occur inside of the user-supplied 
modeling function which is passed into `forecastML::train_model()`. Refer to the wrapper function customization 
vignette for more details.

## Example

Below is an example of how to create 12 horizon-specific ML models to forecast the number of `DriversKilled` 
12 time periods into the future using the `Seatbelts` dataset. Notice in the last plot that there are multiple forecasts; 
these are from the slightly different LASSO models trained in the nested cross-validation. An example of selecting optimal 
hyperparameters and retraining to create a single forecast model (i.e., `create_windows(..., window_length = 0)`) can be found 
in the overview vignette.

``` r
library(glmnet)
library(forecastML)

# Sampled Seatbelts data from the R package datasets.
data("data_seatbelts", package = "forecastML")

# Example - Training data for 12 horizon-specific models w/ common lags per feature. The data do 
# not have any missing rows or temporal gaps in data collection; if there were gaps, 
# we would need to use fill_gaps() first.
horizons <- 1:12  # 12 models that forecast 1, 1:2, 1:3, ..., and 1:12 time steps ahead.
lookback <- 1:15  # A lookback of 1 to 15 dataset rows (1:15 * 'date frequency' if dates are given).

#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Create a dataset of lagged features for modeling.
data_train <- forecastML::create_lagged_df(data_seatbelts, type = "train",
                                           outcome_col = 1, lookback = lookback,

# User-define model - LASSO
# A user-defined wrapper function for model training that takes the following
# arguments: (1) a horizon-specific data.frame made with create_lagged_df(..., type = "train")
# (e.g., my_lagged_df$horizon_h) and, optionally, (2) any number of additional named arguments
# which can also be passed in '...' in train_model(). The function returns a model object suitable for 
# the user-defined predict function. The returned model may also be a list that holds meta-data such 
# as hyperparameter settings.

# create_lagged_df(type = 'forecast') but with the 'index' and 'horizon' columns removed. The function 
# can return a 1- or 3-column data.frame with either (a) point
# forecasts or (b) point forecasts plus lower and upper forecast bounds (column order and names do not matter).
