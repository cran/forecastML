# Purpose

The purpose of `forecastML` is to provide a series of functions and visualizations that simplify the process of 
**multi-step-ahead direct forecasting with standard machine learning algorithms**. It's a wrapper package aimed at providing maximum flexibility in model-building--**choose any machine learning algorithm from any `R` package**--while helping the user quickly assess the (a) accuracy, (b) stability, and (c) generalizability of grouped (i.e., 
multiple related time-series) and ungrouped single-outcome forecasts produced from potentially high-dimensional modeling datasets.

This package is inspired by Bergmeir, Hyndman, and Koo's 2018 paper 
[A note on the validity of cross-validation for evaluating autoregressive time series prediction](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2017.11.003). 
In particular, `forecastML` makes use of 

* **lagged features**,
* **simple wrapper functions that support models from any `R` package**,
* **nested cross-validation** with (a) user-specified standard cross-validation in the inner loop and (b) block-contiguous validation 
datasets in the outer loop, and
* **parallel processing** with the `future` package 

to build and evaluate high-dimensional forecast models **without having to use methods that are time-series specific**. 

The following quote from Bergmeir et al.'s article nicely sums up the aim of this package:

> "When purely (non-linear, nonparametric) autoregressive methods are applied to forecasting problems, as is often the case
> (e.g., when using Machine Learning methods), the aforementioned problems of CV are largely
> irrelevant, and CV can and should be used without modification, as in the independent case."

## Direct forecasting

In contrast to the recursive or iterated method for producing multi-step-ahead forecasts used in traditional forecasting 
methods like ARIMA, direct forecasting involves creating a series of distinct horizon-specific models. Though 
several hybrid methods exist for producing multi-step forecasts, the simple direct forecasting method 
with lagged features used in `forecastML` let's us avoid the exponentially more difficult problem of having to 
"predict the predictors" for forecast horizons beyond 1-step-ahead.

Below are some resources for learning more about multi-step forecasting strategies:

* [A review and comparison of strategies for multi-step-ahead time series forecasting based on the NN5 forecasting competition](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.3259.pdf)
* [A comparison of direct and iterated multistep AR methods for forecasting macroeconomic time series](https://www.princeton.edu/~mwatson/papers/hstep_3.pdf)

The **animation below** shows how historical data is used to create a 1-to-12-step-ahead forecast for a 12-step-horizon 
forecast model using lagged predictors or features. Though feature lags greater than 12 steps can be used to make use of 
additional historical predictive information, a 12-step-horizon direct forecast model requires feature lags >= 12. 
This animation is roughly equivalent to how a 12-period seasonal ARIMA(0, 0, 0)(1, 0, 0) model uses historical data to produce forecasts.

# Example

In this walkthrough of `forecastML` we'll compare the forecast performance of two machine learning 
methods, LASSO and Random Forest, across forecast horizons using the Seatbelts dataset from the `datasets` package.

Here's a summary of the problem at hand:

* **Outcome:**
    * `DriversKilled` - car drivers killed per month in the UK.
* **Predcitors:**
    * `DriversKilled` - car drivers killed per month in the UK.
    * `kms` - a measure of distance driven.
    * `PetrolPrice` - the price of gas.
    * `law` - A binary indicator of the presence of a seatbelt law.
* **Forecast:**
    * Model training - The first 15 years of the monthly dataset.
    * Model testing - The last year of the monthly dataset.

## Install forecastML

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("forecastML")
```


## Load packages and data

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(forecastML)
library(glmnet)
library(randomForest)
library(DT)

data("data_seatbelts", package = "forecastML")
data <- data_seatbelts

data <- data[, c("DriversKilled", "kms", "PetrolPrice", "law")]
DT::datatable(head(data, 5))
```


## Train-test split

* We'll build our models on `data_train` and evaluate their out-of-sample performance on `data_test`.

```{r}
ts_frequency <- 12  # monthly time-series

data_train <- data[1:(nrow(data) - ts_frequency), ]
data_test <- data[(nrow(data) - ts_frequency + 1):nrow(data), ]

p <- ggplot(data, aes(x = 1:nrow(data), y = DriversKilled))
p <- p + geom_line()
p <- p + geom_vline(xintercept = nrow(data_train), color = "red", size = 1.1)
p <- p + theme_bw() + xlab("Index")
p
```


<br>

# Data Preparation

## forecastML::create_lagged_df

We'll create a list of datasets, one for each forecast horizon, with lagged values for each feature. 
The `lookback` argument in `forecastML::create_lagged_df()` specifies the feature lags in dataset rows.

```{r}
horizons <- c(1, 3, 6, 9, 12)
lookback <- 1:15

data_list <- forecastML::create_lagged_df(data_train, type = "train",
                                          outcome_col = 1, lookback = lookback,
                                          horizons = horizons)
```

<br>

Let's view the modeling dataset for a forecast horizon of 6. Notice that "_lag_<lookback>" has been appended to all model features. Grouped and 
static features, covered in the "grouped_forecast" vignette, keep their original names.

```{r}
DT::datatable(head(data_list$horizon_6, 10), options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```

<br>

The plot below illustrates, for a given feature, the number and position (in dataset rows) of lagged features 
created for each forecast horizon/model. The `lookback` argument to `forecastML::created_lagged_df()` was set to 
create lagged features from a minimum of 1 lag to a maximum of 15 lags; however, feature lags that don't support 
direct forecasting at a given forecast horizon are silently removed from the modeling dataset.

```{r}
plot(data_list)
```

<br>

## forecastML::create_windows

`forecastML::create_windows()` creates indices for partitioning the training dataset in the outer loop of a nested 
cross-validation setup. The validation datasets are created in contiguous blocks of `window_length`, as opposed to 
randomly seleted rows, to mimic forecasting over multi-step-ahead forecast horizons. The `skip`, 
`window_start`, and `window_stop` arguments take dataset indices--or dates if a vector of dates is supplied to 
`forecastML::create_lagged_df()`--that allow the user to adjust the number and 
placement of outer loop validation datasets.

```{r, warnings = FALSE, message = FALSE}
windows <- forecastML::create_windows(lagged_df = data_list, window_length = 24, skip = 0,
                                      window_start = NULL, window_stop = NULL,
                                      include_partial_window = TRUE)
windows
```

<br>

Below is a plot of the nested cross-validation outer loop datasets or windows. In our example, 
a `window_length` of 24 (months) resulted in 7 validation windows.

In this nested cross-validation setup, a model is trained with data from 6 windows and 
**forecast accuracy is assessed on the left-out window**. This means that we'll need to train 14 models, 
each selecting different optimal hyperparameters and model coefficients--if available--from 
the inner validation loop.

```{r}
plot(windows, data_list, show_labels = TRUE)
```

<br>

# Model Training

## User-defined modeling function

We'll compare the forecasting performance of two models: (a) a cross-validated LASSO and (b) a non-tuned Random Forest. The following user-defined functions are needed for each model:

* A user-defined wrapper function for model training that takes the following arguments: 
    + **1:** A horizon-specific data.frame made with `create_lagged_df(..., type = "train")` 
    (e.g., my_lagged_df$horizon_h),
    + **2:** optionally, any number of additional named arguments which can be passed as '...' in
    `train_model()` 
    + and **returns** a model object that will be passed into the user-defined `predict()` function.

Any data transformations, hyperparameter tuning, or inner loop cross-validation procedures should take 
place within this function, with the limitation that it ultimately needs to `return()` a model suitable for 
the user-defined `predict()` function; a list can be returned to capture meta-data such as hyperparameter results.

```{r}
# Example 1 - LASSO
# Alternatively, we could define an outcome column identifier argument, say, 'outcome_col = 1' in 
# this function or just 'outcome_col' and then set the argument as 'outcome_col = 1' in train_model().
model_function <- function(data) {

  x <- data[, -(1), drop = FALSE]
  y <- data[, 1, drop = FALSE]
  x <- as.matrix(x, ncol = ncol(x))
  y <- as.matrix(y, ncol = ncol(y))

  model <- glmnet::cv.glmnet(x, y)
  return(model)
}

# Example 2 - Random Forest
# Alternatively, we could define an outcome column identifier argument, say, 'outcome_col = 1' in 
# this function or just 'outcome_col' and then set the argument as 'outcome_col = 1' in train_model().
model_function_2 <- function(data) {

  outcome_names <- names(data)[1]
  model_formula <- formula(paste0(outcome_names,  "~ ."))

  model <- randomForest::randomForest(formula = model_formula, data = data, ntree = 200)
  return(model)
}
```

<br>

## forecastML::train_model

For each modeling approach, LASSO and Random Forest, a total of `N forecast horizons` * `N validation windows` 
models are trained. In this example, that means training **`r length(data_list) * nrow(windows)` models** 
for each algorithm.

These models could be trained in parallel on any OS with the very flexible `future` package by uncommenting the code below and 
setting `use_future = TRUE`. To avoid nested parallelization, models are either trained in parallel across forecast horizons or 
validation windows, whichever is longer (when equal, the default is parallel across forecast horizons). In this example we have 
5 horizon-specific models and 7 validation datasets so the 35 models would be trained in parallel across horizons for a 
given validation dataset.

```{r}
#future::plan(future::multiprocess)

model_results <- forecastML::train_model(data_list, windows, model_name = "LASSO",
                                         model_function, use_future = FALSE)

model_results_2 <- forecastML::train_model(data_list, windows, model_name = "RF", 
                                           model_function_2, use_future = FALSE)
```

<br>

## User-defined prediction function

The following user-defined prediction function is needed for each model:

* A wrapper function that takes the following **2 positional arguments**:
    * **1:** The model returned from the user-defined modeling function.
    * **2:** A `data.frame` of the model features from `forecastML::create_lagged_df(..., type = "train")`.
* and **returns** a `data.frame` of predictions with 1 or 3 columns. A 1-column data.frame will produce point forecasts, 
and a 3-column data.frame can be used to return point, lower, and upper forecasts (column names and order do not matter).

```{r}
# Example 1 - LASSO
prediction_function <- function(model, data_features) {

  x <- as.matrix(data_features, ncol = ncol(data_features))

  data_pred <- data.frame("y_pred" = predict(model, x, s = "lambda.min"))
  return(data_pred)
}

# Example 2 - Random Forest
prediction_function_2 <- function(model, data_features) {

  data_pred <- data.frame("y_pred" = predict(model, data_features))
  return(data_pred)
}
```

<br>

## forecastML::predict

The `predict.forecast_model()` S3 method takes any number of trained models from `train_model()` and a 
list of user-defined prediction functions. The list of prediction functions should appear in the same order 
as the models.

Outer loop nested cross-validation forecasts are returned for each user-defined model, forecast horizon, and 
validation window.

```{r}
data_results <- predict(model_results, model_results_2,
                        prediction_function = list(prediction_function, prediction_function_2), data = data_list)
```

<br>

Let's view the models' predictions. The data.frame with S3 class `training_results` contains the following columns:

* **model:** User-supplied model name in `train_model()`.
* **model_forecast_horizon:** The direct-forecasting time horizon that the model was trained on.
* **window_length:** Validation window length measured in dataset rows.
* **window_number:** Validation dataset number.
* **valid_indices:** Validation dataset row names from `attributes(create_lagged_df())$row_indices`.
* **date_indices:** If given, validation dataset date indices from `attributes(create_lagged_df())$date_indices`.
* **"groups":** If given, the user-supplied groups in `create_lagged_df()`.
* **"outcome_name":** The target being forecasted.
* **"outcome_name" pred:** The model predictions.
* **"outcome_name" pred_lower:** If given, the lower prediction bounds returned by the user-supplied prediction function.
* **"outcome_name" pred_upper:** If given, the upper prediction bounds returned by the user-supplied prediction function.

```{r}
DT::datatable(head(data_results, 100), options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```

<br>

Below is a plot of the forecasts for each validation window at select forecast horizons.

```{r}
plot(data_results, type = "prediction", horizons = c(1, 6, 12))
```

<br>

Below is a plot of the forecast error for select validation windows at select forecast horizons.

```{r}
plot(data_results, type = "residual", horizons = c(1, 6, 12), windows = 5:7)
```

<br>

The plots below are diagnostic plots to check how **forecasts for a target point in time** have 
changed through time by looking at a history of forecasts. In this example, we have 12 forecast 
horizons, 1:12, so each of the 12 colored points represents the origin of the forecast for the black point. In most cases it 
would be reasonable to expect shorter-horizon forecasts to be more accurate than longer-horizon forecasts.

* **Top plot:** Rolling origin forecasts for the last validation window in our training data.
* **Bottom plot:** Rolling origin forecasts for the first three points in our training data.

```{r}
plot(data_results, type = "forecast_stability", windows = max(data_results$window_number))
plot(data_results, type = "forecast_stability", valid_indices = attributes(data_list)$row_indices[1:3])
```

<br>

The `forecast_variability` plot below is a summary of the `forecast_stability` plot. It's a plot 
of the variability of forecasts for a target point in time collapsed across forecast horizons. A 
forecast model that produces greater variability across forecast horizons could be the better model 
provided the forecasts are increasingly accruate at shorter and shorter forecast horizons.

```{r}
plot(data_results, type = "forecast_variability", valid_indices = 30:80)
```

<br>

# Model Performance

## forecastML::return_error

Let's calcuate several common forecast error metrics.

* **mae:** Mean absolute error
* **mape:** Mean absolute percentage error
* **mdape:** Median absolute percentage error
* **smape:** Symmetrical mean absolute percentage error from (Chen and Yang's 2004 formula with a 100% multiplier as 
discussed at [https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/smape/](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/smape/))

The forecast errors for nested cross-validation are returned at 3 levels of granularity:

1. Error by validation window
2. Error by model forecast horizon, collapsed across validation windows
3. Golbal error collapsed across validation windows and model forecast horizons

```{r}
data_error <- forecastML::return_error(data_results, metrics = c("mae", "mape", "smape"),
                                       models = NULL)

DT::datatable(data_error$error_global, options = list(scrollX = TRUE), )
```

<br>
 
Below is a plot of error metrics across time for select validation windows and forecast horizons.

```{r}
plot(data_error, data_results, type = "time", horizons = c(1, 6, 12), windows = 5:7)
```

<br>

Below is a plot of forecast error metrics by forecast model horizon collapsed across validation windows.

```{r}
plot(data_error, data_results, type = "horizon", horizons = c(1, 6, 12))
```

<br>

Below is a plot of error metrics collapsed across validation windows and forecast horizons.

```{r}
plot(data_error, data_results, type = "global")
```

<br>

# Hyperparameters

While it may be reasonable to have distinct models for each forecast horizon or even forecasting model 
ensembles across horizons, at this point we still have slightly different LASSO and Random Forest models 
from the outer loop of the nested cross-validation *within* each horizon-specific model. Here, we'll 
take a look at the stability of the hyperparameters for the LASSO model to better understand if 
we can train one model across forecast horizons or if we need additional predictors or modeling 
strategies to forecast well under various conditions or time-series dynamics.

### User-defined hyperparameter function

The following user-defined hyperparameter function is needed for each model:

* A wrapper function that takes the following **1 positional argument**
    * **1:** The model returned from the user-defined modeling function.
* and **returns** a 1-row `data.frame`.

```{r}
hyper_function <- function(model) {

  lambda_min <- model$lambda.min
  lambda_1se <- model$lambda.1se

  data_hyper <- data.frame("lambda_min" = lambda_min, "lambda_1se" = lambda_1se)
  return(data_hyper)
}
```

<br>

## forecastML::return_hyper

Below are two plots which show (a) univariate hyperparameter variability across the training data 
and (b) the relationship between each error metric and hyperparameter values.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
data_hyper <- forecastML::return_hyper(model_results, hyper_function)

plot(data_hyper, data_results, data_error, type = "stability", horizons = c(1, 6, 12))
plot(data_hyper, data_results, data_error, type = "error", c(1, 6, 12))
```

<br>

# Forecast

## forecastML::create_lagged_df

To forecast with the direct forecasting method, we need to create another dataset of lagged features. 
We can do this by running `create_lagged_df()` and setting `type = "forecast"`.

For non-grouped time-series, this function takes the last rows of `data_train` and creates lagged features that support forecasting from 
1-step-ahead to *h* horizons for each horizon-specific model. Below is the forecast dataset for a 6-step-ahead forecast.

The forecast dataset has the following columns:

* **index:** A column giving the row index or date of the forecast periods (e.g., a 100 row non-date-based training 
dataset would start with an index of 101).
* **horizon:** A column that indicates the forecast period from `1:max(horizons)`.
* **"features":** Lagged features identical to the `type = "train"`, dataset.

```{r}
data_forecast_list <- forecastML::create_lagged_df(data_train, type = "forecast", 
                                                  lookback = lookback,  horizon = horizons)

DT::datatable(head(data_forecast_list$horizon_6), options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```

<br>

## Forecast results

Running the predict method, `predict.forecast_model()`, on the lagged predictor dataset created 
above--with `type = "forecast"`--and placing it in the `data` argument in `predict.forecast_model()` below, returns 
a data.frame of forecasts with the following columns:

* **model:** User-supplied model name in `train_model()`.
* **model_forecast_horizon:** The direct-forecasting time horizon that the model was trained on.
* **horizon:** Forecast horizon, ranging from 1:model_forecast_horizon.
* **window_length:** Validation window length measured in dataset rows.
* **window_number:** Validation dataset number.
* **forecast_period:** The dataset row/date for the forecast.
* **"groups":** If given, the user-supplied groups in `create_lagged_df()`.
* **"outcome_name" pred:** The model forecasts.
* **"outcome_name" pred_lower:** If given, the lower forecast bounds returned by the user-supplied prediction function.
* **"outcome_name" pred_upper:** If given, the upper forecast bounds returned by the user-supplied prediction function.

An S3 object of class, `forecast_results`, is returned. This object will have different plotting and error methods than 
the `training_results` class from earlier.

```{r}
data_forecast <- predict(model_results, model_results_2,
                         prediction_function = list(prediction_function, prediction_function_2), 
                         data = data_forecast_list)

DT::datatable(head(data_forecast, 10), options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```

<br>

Below is a plot of the forecasts vs. the actuals for each model at select forecast horizons.

Setting the `data_actual = ...` and `actual_indices = ...` arguments plots a background dataset (grey line in the plots below).

It's clear from the plots that our Random Forest model is producing less accurate forecasts and is more 
sensitive to the data on which it was trained--producing a handful of erratic forecasts depending on the nested cross-validation data.

```{r}
plot(data_forecast, data_actual = data_train[-(1:150), ],
     actual_indices = as.numeric(row.names(data_train[-(1:150), ])),
     horizons = c(1, 6, 12), facet_plot = c("model", "model_forecast_horizon"))

plot(data_forecast, data_actual = data_test, 
     actual_indices = as.numeric(row.names(data_test)),
     facet_plot = "model", horizons = c(1, 6, 12))
```

<br>

## Forecast error

Finally, we'll look at our out-of-sample forecast error by forecast horizon for our two models by setting `data_test = data_test`.

If the first argument of `forecastML::return_error()` is an object of class `forecast_results` and 
the `data_test` argument is a data.frame like data_test from our beginning train-test split, a data.frame 
of forecast error metrics with the following columns is returned:

* **model:** User-supplied model name in `train_model()`.
* **model_forecast_horizon:** The direct-forecasting time horizon that the model was trained on.
* **horizon:** Forecast horizon, ranging from 1:model_forecast_horizon.
* **"error_metrics":** Forecast error metrics.

```{r}
data_error <- forecastML::return_error(data_forecast, data_test = data_test,
                                       test_indices = as.numeric(row.names(data_test)),
                                       metrics = c("mae", "mape", "smape", "mdape"))

DT::datatable(head(data_error$error_by_horizon, 10), options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
```

<br>

# Model Selection and Re-training

Because our LASSO model is both stabler and more accurate, we'll re-train our model across 
the entire training dataset to get our final `r length(horizons)` models--1 for each forecast horizon. 
Note that for a real-world forecasting problem this is when we would do additional model tuning 
to imrpove forecast accuracy across validation windows as well as narrow the hyperparameter search 
in the user-specified modeling functions.

## forecastML::create_lagged_df

```{r}
data_list <- forecastML::create_lagged_df(data_train, type = "train", 
                                          lookback = lookback, 
                                          horizon = horizons)
```

<br>

## forecastML::create_windows

To create a dataset *without nested cross-validation*, set **`window_length = 0`** in `forecastML::create_windows()`.

```{r}
windows <- forecastML::create_windows(data_list, window_length = 0)

plot(windows, data_list, show_labels = TRUE)
```

<br>

## forecastML::train_model

Without nested cross-validation and holdout windows, the prediction plot is essnetially a plot of model fit.

```{r}
model_results <- forecastML::train_model(data_list, windows,  model_name = "LASSO", model_function)

data_results <- predict(model_results, prediction_function = list(prediction_function), data = data_list)

DT::datatable(head(data_results, 10), options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
plot(data_results, type = "prediction", horizons = c(1, 6, 12))
plot(data_results, type = "residual", horizons = c(1, 6, 12))
plot(data_results, type = "forecast_stability", valid_indices = 109:120)
```

## forecastML::return_error

```{r}
data_error <- forecastML::return_error(data_results, metrics = c("mae", "mape", "mdape", "smape"),
                                       models = NULL)

DT::datatable(head(data_error$error_global), options = list(scrollX = TRUE))
plot(data_error, data_results, type = "horizon")
```

## forecastML::return_hyper

```{r}
data_hyper <- forecastML::return_hyper(model_results, hyper_function)

plot(data_hyper, data_results, data_error, type = "stability", horizons = c(1, 6, 12))
plot(data_hyper, data_results, data_error, type = "error", c(1, 6, 12))
