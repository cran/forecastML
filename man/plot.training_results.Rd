\usage{
\method{plot}{training_results}(
  x,
  type = c("prediction", "residual", "forecast_stability"),
  facet = horizon ~ model,

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class 'training_results' from \code{predict.forecast_model()}.}

\item{type}{Plot type. The default plot is "prediction" for validation dataset predictions.}

\item{facet}{Optional. For numeric outcomes, a formula with any combination of \code{horizon}, \code{model}, or \code{group} (for grouped time series)
passed to \code{ggplot2::facet_grid()} internally (e.g., \code{horizon ~ model}, \code{horizon + model ~ .}, \code{~ horizon + group}).}

\item{models}{Optional. Filter results by user-defined model name from \code{train_model()}.}

\item{horizons}{Optional. A numeric vector of model forecast horizons to filter results by horizon-specific model.}

\item{windows}{Optional. A numeric vector of window numbers to filter results.}

\item{valid_indices}{Optional. A numeric or date vector to filter results by validation row indices or dates.}

\item{group_filter}{Optional. A string for filtering plot results for grouped time series
(e.g., \code{"group_col_1 == 'A'"}). The results are passed to \code{dplyr::filter()} internally.}

\item{keep_missing}{Boolean. If \code{TRUE}, predictions are plotted for indices/dates where the outcome is missing.}

\item{...}{Not used.}
}
\value{
Diagnostic plots of class 'ggplot'.
}
\description{
Several diagnostic plots can be returned to assess the quality of the forecasts
based on predictions on the validation datasets.
